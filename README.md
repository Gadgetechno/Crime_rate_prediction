# 🕵️ Crime Rate Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting crime trends using historical data and machine learning techniques. By analyzing patterns in crime data, the system can help in proactive decision-making, optimal resource allocation, and public safety enhancement.

## 📌 Project Overview

Crime is a growing concern in urban and rural areas alike. Predicting future crimes based on historical data enables law enforcement and government agencies to be better prepared. This project involves:

- Collecting crime datasets
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training ML models for classification/regression
- Visualizing results for insight-driven decisions

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used includes historical crime records, with features like:

- Crime Type
- Date & Time
- Location (Latitude, Longitude)
- Demographics (Population, Unemployment, etc.)

Sources may include:
- [Kaggle Open Crime Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)
- Local government data portals

## 🧠 Model Training

We trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models. Metrics used for evaluation:

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- Heatmaps for feature correlation  
- Bar charts for crime frequency  
- Time-series plots for trend analysis  
- Geospatial maps for crime hotspots  
- Performance comparison of ML models
